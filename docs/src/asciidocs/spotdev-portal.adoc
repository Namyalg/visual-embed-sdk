Hides the default data panel.

+
Hide chart or table::
Hides the visualizations displayed as search results.

+
Modify available actions::
Disables or hides the specified action menu items in the **More** menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu], or the menu bar in the search answer page. 
+
For example:

+
* To disable the **Replay Search** action menu item from the **More** menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu], set the value of the `disabledActions` attribute to `replaySearch`. 
+
----
disabledActions: ['replaySearch']
----
+
* To display a tooltip for the disabled menu item, specify the reason for disabling the menu item in the `disabledActionReason` attribute.

+
Add search tokens::
Enables constructing a search query using search tokens.
+ 
In the following example, to fetch the total revenue data by shipping mode, the `searchQuery` string uses the xref:search-data-api.adoc#column[Column] search token:

----
searchQuery: "[Revenue] by [Shipmode]"
----
+
////
The search query typically includes the following parameters:
+
`query-string`::
 _String_. The data search query string. For more information on the search query string components, see xref:search-data-api.adoc##components[Components of a search query].
`data_source_guide`::
_String_. The GUID of the data source, either a worksheet, a view, or a table.
`batchsize`::
_Integer_. The batch size for loading search objects. The default value is `-1`.
`pagenumber`::
_Integer_.Alternate way to set offset for the starting point of the search results returned from the query. The default value is `-1`.

+ 
----
indexingOffset = (pageNumber - 1) * batchSize
----
`offset`::
_Integer_. Attribute to offset the starting point of the search results returned from the query.  Specify a 1-based offset. The default value is `-1`.

`formattype`::
The format of the data.
Valid values are `COMPACT` or `FULL JSON`.
